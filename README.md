# Sonar Rock vs Mine Classification ðŸ”ŠðŸª¨ðŸ’£

This mini project uses a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either **rock** or **mine** based on sonar returns. The dataset used contains 208 samples with 60 features each, representing sonar signal returns.


## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Model Used
- Logistic Regression 

The notebook covers:
	â€¢	Data exploration and preprocessing
	â€¢	Train-test splitting
	â€¢	Model building using Logistic Regression 
	â€¢	Accuracy and performance evaluation
